# files-with-incrementable-names
Simple counters you interact with by clicking on them to increment their number-representing names by 1.

## Motivation
Back in 2019, I had a habit of keeping an empty txt file with every digital book I was reading and every downloaded TV show I was watching to track progress. For example, after watching episodes 1 through 4 of a show I'd update the filename to 4. A simple, yet tedious system. Shortly after learning the basics of Python, I've discovered its OS module, and one question struck me: Can a python script change its own name? A dangerous thought indeed, and not the smartest thing to do in general, but maybe I could use it improve my miserable system a bit. After a few searches through Python docs I managed to complete my first working version, and began to use it. Later, I migrated to batch implementation which was clearly better suited for my use-case (took 2 lines of code, noticeably faster, works on every windows machine). Nowadays, I rarely use this tracking system as I've switched to online trackers for TV shows, and my e-book automatically jumps to the last page read after turning on. Then why do I keep adding new implementations to this repo? I just find the specification to work great as a warm-up when picking up a new programming language, as it requires you to answer few straight-forward anwsers with not-so-obvious answers, while teaching you basics of file-handling and number-handling. You could call it a weird "Hello World"!

## Example usage:
- Put it in a folder with a downloaded TV show to easily track episodes you've watched.
